**Overview**

The purpose of this analysis is to check if the weather attributes (temperature, wind speed, humitiity, and cloudiness) of cities in correlation with their distdance from the equator.  The results are found in _WeatherPy.ipynb_ with select plots in the _output_data_ folder.  The data acquired was then filtered to get cities with specific conitional weather attributes and the nearst hotels where assigned to the cities.  Results in _VacationPy.ipynb_.  

**Summary**

Based on the data, the closer cities are to the equator (latitude = 0), the more the temperature increases whether the city is in the northern or southern hemisphere.  There was no significant correlation with the latitude of a city and the humitity, cloudiness, or wind speed.  That being said, the datapoints for the southern hemisphere seem to cluster in the lower wind speed with cities close to the equator.

The last map in _VacationPy.ipynb_ shows a sample of cities that have temperatures between 21 - 30 degrees Celcius and 0 cloudiness.  There is also the nearest hotel in the city.
